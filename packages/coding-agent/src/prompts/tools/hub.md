Agent coordination: peer messaging, background-job control, and supervised long-running processes. Main agent is `Main`; subagents inherit task ID.
Use `op: "list"` to discover peers. Address peers by exact roster ID — NEVER invent names.

# Messaging & Jobs

Background jobs auto-deliver. Active task batches use independent aggregate wake messages owned by the runtime; read-only `jobs`/`wait` snapshots never consume those aggregates.

- **`send`** (with `to`): fire-and-forget, NEVER blocks. Delivery receipts (`delivered`/`failed`) immediate; `failed` → peer gone, don't retry.
  Sending wakes `idle`/`parked` peers. Answering: lead with answer, NEVER quote, set `replyTo`.
- **Format**: plain prose ONLY. No JSON status objects. Share paths via `local://`/`artifact://` URLs, not pasted blobs.
- **`wait`**: use for peer messages or ungated jobs only when completely blocked. It returns on the FIRST incoming message, ungated job settlement, window expiry, or steering interrupt. Running jobs owned by an active task batch are excluded because the runtime parks and resumes Main; a gated-only wait returns immediately as useless.
  - Bare `wait` watches ungated running jobs and incoming messages. `ids` narrows to specific ungated jobs; `from` narrows to one peer (or use `await: true` on send).
- **`inbox`**: drain queued messages without blocking.
- **`cancel`**: kill background jobs by `ids` when they have hung, stalled, or are no longer needed. Returns immediately.
- **`jobs`**: read-only snapshot of every job, including gated jobs, plus running subagents with no job entry. It never acknowledges jobs in an active batch. Coordinate with a peer through `send` only for an explicit dependency, failure, or blocker—not elapsed time.
- Job rows are process-local and expire roughly five minutes after settlement. Afterward, use the agent ID with `send`, `agent://<id>`, or `history://<id>`.
- `completed` means successful yield/job exit, not artifact acceptance. Verify claimed changes.
- NEVER use shell tools, grep, or read other sessions' files to figure out what a peer is doing. Message them directly.
- NEVER use hub messaging for something a tool can answer (e.g., grepping codebase, running a build).

# Processes

Project-scoped long-running processes shared by every omp instance in the same directory. A long-running service, watcher, debugger, REPL, or process needing later input MUST use `op:"start"`, not `bash`.

- **`start`** launches `application` + `args` directly. `cwd` defaults to the session directory; `pty` defaults true.
  - `ready.log` is a regex; `ready.port` is a TCP port. Both supplied? BOTH MUST pass. `ready.timeout` is seconds. Readiness MUST be observed; process creation alone is not readiness.
  - Names are unique per project directory. A completed name MAY be started again; a live name MUST be stopped or restarted.
  - `restart` policy defaults `no`; `on-failure` and `always` use bounded backoff.
  - `persist: true` opts out of last-omp teardown; `detached: true` survives broker shutdown and all omp exits (implies persist, disables PTY input). Omit both unless their survival guarantees are required.
- **`ps`**, **`logs`**, **`wait`** (with `name`), **`send`** (with `name`), **`stop`**, **`restart`**, and **`describe`** address the stable `name`.
- **`logs`** defaults to the last 100 lines. `head: true` reads the beginning. `grep` is a regex. `follow: true` waits for output after `cursor`; reuse the returned cursor on the next call.
- **`wait`** with `name` blocks until readiness/exit/`pattern` or `timeout` (seconds).
- **`send`** with `name`: `text` writes stdin (`enter` defaults true); `keys` supports ENTER, TAB, ESCAPE, CTRL_C, CTRL_D, UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT; `signal` supports SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP, SIGQUIT, SIGKILL. PTY input is serialized; writes share one input stream.
- **`stop`** performs graceful process-tree termination before hard-kill; NEVER kill an unverified PID through bash. **`restart`** reuses the retained launch spec.
